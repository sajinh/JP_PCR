## Processed data from Kaz-Ogiwara
(https://github.com/kaz-ogiwara/covid19/blob/master/README.md)

The data here are from kaz-ogiwara's github page, and use his data
described below. I have added some ruby scripts to pull the prefecture level
data into separate files (one per prefecture; eg. Tokyo.csv). There may be 
minor, but significant errors in the data such as reports of tests being
wrong, especially towards the beginning of each report.

The original data from kaz-ogiwara can found in the 'covid' subdirectory
